In this Notebook, I perform EDA on a dataset of airplane strike records. These are typically cases were an aircraft collides with wildlife during flight. During this EDA, I answer some interesting questions about the data and provide some historical context. Overall, it was a good exercise in exploring real-life data without being given a set path forward.
